## Notes

1. Can a human with no prior knowledge, educated on nothing but a diet of your training dataset, solve the problem?
2. Is your network looking at your data through the right lens?
3. Is your network learning the quirks in your training dataset, or is it learning to solve the problem at hand?
4. Does your network have siblings that can give it a leg-up (through pre-trained weights)?
5. Is your network incapable or just lazy? If itâ€™s the latter, how do you force it to learn?
