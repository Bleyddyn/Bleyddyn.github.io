## Notes

The paper looks at a model that can be used with CNN's and LSTM's to reason about the relationships between objects.
End to end training lets the RN train the upstream NN's to output 'objects' to be used as input the RN.
It seems like it might eventually be useful for planning routes for a robot or for building a 3D model from image+time inputs.
