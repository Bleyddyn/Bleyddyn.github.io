There's no way it would unfold this way, but I like this idea a lot more than the time-travel theories I've read...

Nebula arrives at Earth and learns of the healing particles that Ant-Man brought back from the quantum realm. She decides her sister is more important and abandons the fight against Thanos, steals the particles and heads off to find Gamora (how does she know where to go?).

She heals/resurrects Gamora just as the rest of the Avengers start to fight Thanos.

The Soul stone metaphorically but quite painfully taps Thanos on the shoulder and says something like “Hey, pal, you reneged on your part of the bargain, so I'm going have to undo everything I helped you do.”

People suddenly un-dust, the Soul stone leaves to find a new secret hiding place, in the process destroying the Infinity Gauntlet (quite explosively, scattering infinity stones all over the battlefield), and Thanos is considerably injured (i.e. missing a hand).

Thanos recovers some of the stones, but some are picked up by worthy and/or suicidal Avengers.

Epic battle, some deaths, heroes win, end credits.
