**Ma**chine **L**earning on a Raspberry **Pi** (also a *subtle* reference to the Stargate shows)

A robotics project for playing around with hardware and learning to use Machine Learning techniques.

## Project Goals

{:start="0"}
0. To have MaLPi drive around a DIYRoboCar race track. (I got a bit side-tracked)
1. To have MaLPi able to wander around without bumping into things (much).
2. To have MaLPi able to return to it's charging station before the battery(ies) run down.
3. Eventually, have MaLPi actively search out new places/views, i.e. explore.

## Current Hardware

![](/images/MaLPi_v3.jpeg "MaLPi")

* [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.adafruit.com/products/3055) $39.95
* [Raspberry Pi Camera Board v2 - 8 Megapixels](https://www.adafruit.com/products/3099) $29.95
  * Unlike a standard DonkeyCar I don't use a wide-angle version.
* [Raspberry Pi Camera Case for V2 8 Megapixel](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IJZJKK4) $8.49
* Unknown make/model battery $40?
  * Bought from the California Browncoats booth at Comic-Con.
  * Unfortunately, it does not support pass-through charging.
  * Only used to power the Raspberry Pi.
* Servo driver
* [Exceed Racing Desert Monster 1/16 Scale Truck ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9269802132) ~$90
  * This particular model may not always be available. Check the [DonkeyCar website](https://www.donkeycar.com/) for up-to-date build instructions.
* Relatively standard DonkeyCar [base plate and arch](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2566276)
  * Printed on an Ender 3.

Estimated total hardware costs: $210-$230

## Previous Hardware Versions

* [MaLPi v2](/malpi-v2/)
* MaLPi v1 was largely built using lego parts and spare motors I had lying around. It never got far enough along to actually drive.
