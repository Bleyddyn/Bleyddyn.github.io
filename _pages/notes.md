From [this article](http://sdtimes.com/realities-machine-learning-systems/):

"...in 1957, psychologist Frank Rosenblatt invented the perceptron, or an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers."

Find or write up a brief description of the Perceptron and maybe a couple of other important ML advances.
