## The Good

### Sail Freight/Passengers

A few companies that are trying to return to low/zero emission sailing ships for cargo and passengers. A very, very small drop in the bucket of international shipping, but better than nothing.

[SailCargo Inc.][1]

- Vega:
   * 3 masted square-rigged schooner
   * Cargo Cap: 82 dwt, 148 m3
   * Auxiliary: ?
   * Started: 2023
- Ceiba:
   * 3 masted square-rigged schooner
   * Cargo Cap: 190 metric tons, 350 m3 (9 TEU equivalent)
   * Auxiliary: Electric
   * Started: Estimated 2025
- Cargo: Coffee
- Routes: Columbia to New Jersey

[Timbercoast][2]

- Timbercoast:
   * 2 masted schooner
   * Auxiliary: Diesel 
   * Cargo Cap: 114 dwt, 135 m3
   * Solar: 2.1 kW

- A cruise line that uses sail-powered ships. I would guess they have plenty of fossil-fuel engines for auxiliary power, but their web site is unclear.
