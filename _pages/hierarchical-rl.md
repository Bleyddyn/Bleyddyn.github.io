# Read

* [Hierarchical and Interpretable Skill Acquisition in Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning](https://einstein.ai/static/images/pages/research/hierarchical-reinforcement-learning/iclr2018_HRL.pdf)
* [Hierarchical Imitation and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00590)
  * Top level learns which sub-goal policy to run
  * Low levels learn actions to take and possibly when to end sub-goal
  * Expert input (DAgger-like) can be full labelling at either level or simple Yes/No ("Inspect") at either level
